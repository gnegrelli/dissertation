This project proposes the development of a software for identification of wind power plant equivalent models. To achieve this goal, a generic model well-known in the literature, capable of representing wind power plants during transients, was chosen. The method applied to identify the model is composed of two optimization algorithms. At the begining of the process, an heuristic approach based on Mean-Variance Mapping Optimization is used in order to reduce the parameter's search region around a possible solution. Afterward, a non-linear algorithm based on Trajectory Sensitivity is used to determine the local minimum and estimate the parameters. The method validation will be made using data from simulated systems. Also, a guided user interface will be developed in Python for this application, aiding new users.
