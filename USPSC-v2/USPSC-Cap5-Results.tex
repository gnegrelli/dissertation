The estimation package was applied on the mathematical models presented in Chapter \ref{ch: Models} used to represent wind power plants. On both cases, the hybrid estimation method presented in Section \ref{sec: Hybrid_Method} was applied, with MVMO providing a smart initial solution that will be refined by TSM. The results of these estimation processes are shown in the following sections of this chapter. A study on the effects of population size on MVMO convergence time was also made and its results are depicted below.

Besides, in order to evaluate the package support on models of different systems, it was used to estimate the parameters of a Spring-Mass system and a Linearized Z-IM Load Model. The estimation of these models is presented in the appendices.
