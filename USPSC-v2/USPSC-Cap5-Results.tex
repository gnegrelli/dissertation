\label{ch: Results}

The estimation package was applied on the mathematical models presented in Chapter \ref{ch: Models} used to represent wind power plants. Also, in order to evaluate the package support on models of different systems, it was used to estimate the parameters of a Spring-Mass system and a Linearized Z-IM Load Model. The results of these estimation processes are shown in the following sections of this chapter.
