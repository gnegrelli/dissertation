\chapter{Software Concept}

\label{ch: software}

In this chapter, the concept behind the software in development is presented. The entire software will be developed using Python, a powerful, simple and fast high-level programming language that has gained large space in various sectors of industry and academy. Its rise is due mainly to the enormous number of libraries and forums developed and maintained by the users. Some examples of libraries used in this project are numpy (for scientific computing), matplotlib (plotting library), Tkinter and Qt (GUI toolkit). Python is also open-source, not requiring a paid software to code and most of its applications are free.

The software in development will be non-specific 

instead it will be generic
