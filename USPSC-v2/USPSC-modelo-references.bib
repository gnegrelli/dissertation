	abstract = {Wind energy will continue to grow at a rapid pace and will provide an increasingly large portion of the total electricity 					generation. To achieve its full potential, the industry needs adequate wind-turbine generator (WTG) dynamic models to 						determine the impact of adding wind generation, and establish how the system needs to be upgraded.For the most part, WTG 					manufacturers have sponsored the development of WTG dynamic models. Models developed under this paradigm tend to be 							proprietary and specific to a particular WTG model. They often disclosed under confidential terms for interconnection 						studies and design of individual projects. However, once the projects are installed, the use of proprietary models is 						incompatible with critical grid planning activities that are conducted by regional reliability organizations as a 							collaborative effort among many stakeholders. In this context, the use of generic or simplified models is desirable. To 						address this industry need, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has embarked on the development of generic 				positive sequence WTG models for large- scale power system transient stability analysis. As an integral part of this WECC 					activity, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is engaged in a model validation effort. This paper discusses 						the process of model validation against field measurements. The procedure is illustrated with a specific example.},

	abstract = {The need for generic, standard, non-proprietary models for wind power plants continues to be the subject of much 							discussion and debate. From a technical point of view, the representation of the often complex dynamic behavior of modern 					wind power plants is not trivial. However, system planners and compliance organizations continue to struggle with the 						process deficiencies associated with the black-box and proprietary nature of manufacturer-specific models. For several 						years, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has championed the development of generic models for wind power 				plant models, and the progress to date is reported in this document. Recently, other organizations including the 							International Electromechanical Commission (IEC), manufacturers, software developers, and even utilities have been 							pursuing similar technical goals. It is anticipated that, through the collective efforts of these stakeholders, generic 						models will fulfill a much needed gap. This paper reports on the progress made to-date within the Western Electricity 						Coordinating Council (WECC) regarding the development of generic models suitable for representing wind power plants in 						typical transmission planning studies.

@inproceedings{Muljadi2010,
	abstract = {An important aspect of wind power plant (WPP) impact studies is to evaluate the short circuit (SC) current contribution of 				the plant into the transmission network under different fault conditions. This task can be challenging to protection 						engineers due to the topology differences between different types of wind turbine generators (WTGs) and the conventional 					generating units. This paper presents simulation results for SC current contribution for different types of WTGs obtained 					through transient analysis using generic WTG models. The obtained waveforms are analyzed to explain the behavior, such as 					peak values and rate of decay, of the WTG. The effect of fault types and location, and the effect of the control 							algorithms of power converters on SC current contribution are also investigated. We show that the response of the WPP to 					faults will vary based on the type of the installed WTGs. While in Type 1 and Type 2 WTGs, SC current will be determined 					by the physical characteristics of the induction generator, the contribution of Type 3 and Type 4 WTG will be mostly 						characterized by the power converter's control algorithms, which are usually considered proprietary information by the 						wind turbine manufacturers.},

The onshore and offshore wind farm configurations are analyzed with respect to the series/							parallel connection of wind turbine ac/dc output terminals, and high voltage ac/dc transmission. The fault-ride through 						compliance methods used in the induction and synchronous generator based WECS are also discussed. The past, present and 						future trends in megawatt WECS are reviewed in terms of mechanical and electrical technologies, integration to power 						systems, and control theory.
