	abstract = {Wind energy will continue to grow at a rapid pace and will provide an increasingly large portion of the total electricity 					generation. To achieve its full potential, the industry needs adequate wind-turbine generator (WTG) dynamic models to 						determine the impact of adding wind generation, and establish how the system needs to be upgraded.For the most part, WTG 					manufacturers have sponsored the development of WTG dynamic models. Models developed under this paradigm tend to be 							proprietary and specific to a particular WTG model. They often disclosed under confidential terms for interconnection 						studies and design of individual projects. However, once the projects are installed, the use of proprietary models is 						incompatible with critical grid planning activities that are conducted by regional reliability organizations as a 							collaborative effort among many stakeholders. In this context, the use of generic or simplified models is desirable. To 						address this industry need, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has embarked on the development of generic 				positive sequence WTG models for large- scale power system transient stability analysis. As an integral part of this WECC 					activity, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is engaged in a model validation effort.

	abstract = {The need for generic, standard, non-proprietary models for wind power plants continues to be the subject of much 							discussion and debate. From a technical point of view, the representation of the often complex dynamic behavior of modern 					wind power plants is not trivial.

For several 						years, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has championed the development of generic models for wind power 				plant models, and the progress to date is reported in this document.

It is anticipated that, through the collective efforts of these stakeholders, generic 						models will fulfill a much needed gap. This paper reports on the progress made to-date within the Western Electricity 						Coordinating Council (WECC) regarding the development of generic models suitable for representing wind power plants in 						typical transmission planning studies.

	abstract = {An important aspect of wind power plant (WPP) impact studies is to evaluate the short circuit (SC) current contribution of 				the plant into the transmission network under different fault conditions. This task can be challenging to protection 						engineers due to the topology differences between different types of wind turbine generators (WTGs) and the conventional 					generating units. This paper presents simulation results for SC current contribution for different types of WTGs obtained 					through transient analysis using generic WTG models. The obtained waveforms are analyzed to explain the behavior, such as 					peak values and rate of decay, of the WTG. The effect of fault types and location, and the effect of the control 							algorithms of power converters on SC current contribution are also investigated. We show that the response of the WPP to 					faults will vary based on the type of the installed WTGs. While in Type 1 and Type 2 WTGs, SC current will be determined 					by the physical characteristics of the induction generator, the contribution of Type 3 and Type 4 WTG will be mostly 						characterized by the power converter's control algorithms, which are usually considered proprietary information by the 						wind turbine manufacturers.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new approach combining synchronization techniques and trajectory sensitivity analysis is proposed to 						estimate the parameters of electrical synchronous generator models. The main contribution of this combination is the 						improvement on the numerical robustness of the estimation algorithm. The synchronization technique consists of coupling 						the real system with the mathematical model. The coupling is of unilateral type, that is, some outputs of the real system 					are considered inputs of the mathematical model. With a convenient choice of coupling, parameters that would have 							difficulties to be estimated by the traditional approach (due in general to very low sensitivity) can be more easily 						estimated. The proposed methodology is appropriate for on-line applications and does not require special operating 							conditions. Indeed, it can naturally deal with generator model nonlinearities. The methodology was successfully applied to 				estimate the parameters of a two-axis synchronous generator model. Synchronization improved the numerical robustness of 						the estimation algorithm allowing the simultaneous estimation of the d and q axis parameters even for bad initial guesses 					of parameters},

@inproceedings{Cari2015,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. An assessment of parameter observability to identify an equivalent wind power plant model is 					proposed in this paper. The trajectory sensitivity method is used as an updating rule to iteratively improve the 							estimation of the model parameters. The difficulties for obtaining the correct estimation are analyzed and a strategy to 					overcome those problems are highlighted. In general those problems are related to parameter divergence during the 							estimation process, specially when the initial parameter guesses are far away from the true values and when the 								sensitivities of the parameters with relation to the model output are low. Those problems become more evident as the 						number of parameter to be simultaneously estimated increases. The proposed strategy splits the estimation procedure into 					different stages of different window time, facilitating the estimation of parameters. The robustness of the proposed 						method with relation to initial parameter guesses is verified by estimating parameters in different scenarios and with the 				addition of noise in the measurements.},

In this paper, four dynamic load models are 						identified based on multiple online measurement data from the Taiwan Power System.

A simple and efficient method is presented to estimate a representative 							parameter set for different loading conditions. The cross-validation technique is applied to validate the four dynamic 						load models in order to obtain a better estimate of their performance.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the modeling of the doublyfed induction generator (DFIG) for stability studies. Using the space-phasor representation and the underlying quasi stationary model, suitable control algorithms for the simulation of the DFIG operating on an interconnected system is developed. The schemes include the pitch-angle/speed control and the decoupled control of the real and reactive power outputs. The model is then implemented on a large test network. Simulations have been carried out to study the control behavior of wind turbines to wind speed changes and the response to three phase grid faults. The results demonstrate the suitability of the models and the overall control architecture for stability studies and give insight into the scope of possible targeted control interventions. The short-circuit test in particular highlights the relationship between the control philosophy adopted and the possibility of the DFIG actively participating in supporting the network voltage. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
