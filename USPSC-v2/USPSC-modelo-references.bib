@article{Muljadi2008,
	abstract = {Wind energy will continue to grow at a rapid pace and will provide an increasingly large portion of the total electricity 					generation. To achieve its full potential, the industry needs adequate wind-turbine generator (WTG) dynamic models to 						determine the impact of adding wind generation, and establish how the system needs to be upgraded.For the most part, WTG 					manufacturers have sponsored the development of WTG dynamic models. Models developed under this paradigm tend to be 							proprietary and specific to a particular WTG model. They often disclosed under confidential terms for interconnection 						studies and design of individual projects. However, once the projects are installed, the use of proprietary models is 						incompatible with critical grid planning activities that are conducted by regional reliability organizations as a 							collaborative effort among many stakeholders. In this context, the use of generic or simplified models is desirable. To 						address this industry need, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has embarked on the development of generic 				positive sequence WTG models for large- scale power system transient stability analysis. As an integral part of this WECC 					activity, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is engaged in a model validation effort. This paper discusses 						the process of model validation against field measurements. The procedure is illustrated with a specific example.},

@article{Ellis2011,
	abstract = {The need for generic, standard, non-proprietary models for wind power plants continues to be the subject of much 							discussion and debate. From a technical point of view, the representation of the often complex dynamic behavior of modern 					wind power plants is not trivial. However, system planners and compliance organizations continue to struggle with the 						process deficiencies associated with the black-box and proprietary nature of manufacturer-specific models. For several 						years, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has championed the development of generic models for wind power 				plant models, and the progress to date is reported in this document. Recently, other organizations including the 							International Electromechanical Commission (IEC), manufacturers, software developers, and even utilities have been 							pursuing similar technical goals. It is anticipated that, through the collective efforts of these stakeholders, generic 						models will fulfill a much needed gap. This paper reports on the progress made to-date within the Western Electricity 						Coordinating Council (WECC) regarding the development of generic models suitable for representing wind power plants in 						typical transmission planning studies. The manuscript address technical issues associated with the representation of wind 					turbine generators for load flow and transient stability analyses. Current capabilities and envisioned enhancements to 						existing models are also discussed.},
