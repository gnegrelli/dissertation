\chapter{Expected Results}

\label{ch: Res}

The expected result of this work is a software capable of correctly estimating the parameters of Type-3 WTG's mathematical model. To do so, the software will apply the proposed estimation method comprises of MVMO and TS methods combined. 

The real model behaviour will be obtained through simulation on specific software, such as DIgSILENT or MATLAB, and real data, if available. At first, Erlich's model will be employing, but it can be further changed if needed. Also, other estimation methods, such as PSO, ED or Kalman Filters, may be implemented and their performance compared.

The hybrid approach for parameters estimation presented in this work is already implemented and have shown great results for models. As depicted in Figure \ref{fig: spring-mass}, the proposed method can correctly identify the parameters of a spring-mass system. The same application was employed on load model identification and is subject of a paper presented by the author on the 2019 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering.
