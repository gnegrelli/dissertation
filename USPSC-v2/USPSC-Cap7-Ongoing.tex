The estimation framework and GUI developed by the author and presented in this dissertation can be further improved in the future. New estimation methods, such as Kalman Filters, Monte Carlo, Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution, may be implemented to enlarge user options. Moreover, additional estimation steps, such as identifiability analysis, can be applied to validate and provide more information about the process. Further studies on the proposed WPP model are also needed in order to validate its application. Improvements on GUI may surface as other features are created and new users start applying the tool.
