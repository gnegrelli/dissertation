During the last decade, the world has seen an increase in participation of renewable sources in power generation, leaded mainly by wind and solar energy. These green technologies provide an alternative to sources based on fossil fuel, lowering pollution levels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the power output from these sources rely on weather conditions and can't be fully controlled.

This increase is seen worldwide, as part of policies to reduce the human impact on climate and the environment. This `renewable wave' is leaded mainly by European countries, specially in the European Union (EU), United States (US) and China. In particular, EU has set in 2010 a strategy plan to reduce its greenhouse emissions by at least 20\% compared to 1990 levels and increase the share of renewable sources to at least 20\% by 2020 \cite{Europe2020}.

Brazil does not lag far behind EU regarding renewable sources policies. In 2002, the country passed a bill that, among other actions, creates the Program of Incentive to Alternative Electric Energy Sources (PROINFA). This program aims to increase the share of wind, solar, small hydro and biomass energy production. The final goal is to have these energy sources corresponding to 10\% of Brazil's annual energy consumption by 2024 \cite{Brazil2002}.

\section{Wind Energy}

Those policies stimulated the increase of wind energy participation, reaching a scenario where it is the main energy source of some countries. In the EU, wind energy alone generated 362 TWh in 2018, covering 14\% of the electricity demand, a share 2\% higher than 2017. Among the EU countries, Denmark leads in this sector, with 41\% of its demand supplied by wind power plants, followed by Ireland (28\%), Portugal (24\%) and Germany (21\%). The total installed capacity across the 28 EU countries is 178.8 GW, with Germany in first position, with a total installed capacity of 59.3 GW, followed by Spain and the United Kingdom (UK), with 23.5 and 21.0 GW installed, respectively \cite{WindEurope2019}. Figure \ref{fig: EUrank} displays the detailed percentage of electricity demand covered by wind in the EU.

In Brazil, wind energy contributed with 42.4 TWh during 2017, resulting in a participation share of 7.2\%. For comparison, Itaipu, the largest power plant in Brazil, has produced 96.4 TWh during the same period. But, while other sources, such as hydro and coal, had its share lowered, wind energy had the highest variation among sources comparing to 2016, increasing its contribution by 26.5\% \cite{EPE2018}. 

In therms of installed capacity, wind power plants appear in \nth{2} place, with 14.7 GW installed, only behind hydro power plants \cite{ABEEolica2018}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: BRshare}. However, there is still plenty of energy yield for this source to be explored. In \cite{Atlas2001} is shown that Brazil has potential to generate 272.2 TWh per year, with an installed capacity of 143.5 GW. The Northeast Region has the higher potential, with an annual energy yield of 144.3 TWh and potential to host up to 75.0 GW . Also, the wind regime in the Northeast Region is complimentary to the water regime of the main river responsible to power generation in the region, as presented by Figure \ref{fig: WindWater}. This characteristic would help controlling reservoir water level during dry season, an important resource not only for power generation, but also irrigation of crops and water supply \cite{ANEEL2005}.

With all this information in hand, it is only reasonable to assume that wind energy will increase its participation in electricity generation. However, some aspects of the wind energy must be considered prior to the implementation on large scale of wind power plants.

The main difficulties are due to the nature of the energy source and the generator's characteristics. The wind regime is not constant and evenly distributed across the country, depending on the region's geography and vegetation. This results in a energy source that is not entirely reliable and concentrated on a certain area. Wind turbine generators usually have their rotor decoupled from the grid via frequency converter, leading to their low inertia. Thus, the system may experience stability problems during transients due to the high penetration of these machines \cite{Xiong2019}.

In order to maintain the electrical power system reliable, studies simulating various conditions must be performed beforehand, so the operators can be prepared for every occasion. These studies require mathematical models capable of adequately simulate the behaviour of every component on the grid. Particularly for wind power plants, an equivalent model is needed, since these facilities are usually largely spread and contain generators from different sizes and manufacturers. 

\section{Research Goals}

The main goal of this research is to estimate parameters of an equivalent model of wind power plants. This will aid the studies concerning the system transient stability. To do so, an algorithm for parameter estimation will be developed combining two methods: Mean-Variance Mapping Optimization, an population-based heuristic approach, and Trajectory Sensitivity Method, a nonlinear approach. Also, as a secondary goal, a software, with graphical interface, for parameter estimation of nonlinear models will be developed.
