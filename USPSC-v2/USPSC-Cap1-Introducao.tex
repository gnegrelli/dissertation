\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}

During the last decade, the world has seen an increase in participation of renewable sources in power generation, leaded mainly by wind and solar energy. These green technologies provide an alternative to sources based on fossil fuel, lowering pollution levels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the power output from these sources rely on weather conditions and can't be fully controlled.

This increase is seen worldwide, as part of policies to reduce the human impact on climate and the environment. This `renewable wave' is leaded mainly by European countries, specially in the European Union (EU), United States (US) and China. In particular, EU has set in 2010 a strategy plan to reduce its greenhouse emissions by at least 20\% compared to 1990 levels and increase the share of renewable sources to at least 20\% by 2020 \cite{Europe2020}.

Brazil does not lag far behind EU regarding renewable sources policies. In 2002, the country passed a bill that, among other actions, creates the Program of Incentive to Alternative Electric Energy Sources (PROINFA). This program aims to increase the share of wind, solar, small hydro and biomass energy production. The final goal is to have these resources corresponding to 10\% of Brazil's annual energy consumption \cite{PROINFA2002}.

\section{Wind Energy}

Those policies stimulated the increase of wind energy participation, reaching a scenario where it is the main energy source of some countries. In the EU, wind energy alone generated 362 TWh in 2018, covering 14\% of the electricity demand, a share 2\% higher than 2017. Breaking down to countries, Denmark leads in this sector, with 41\% of its demand supplied by wind power plants, followed by Ireland (28\%), Portugal (24\%) and Germany (21\%). The total installed capacity across the 28 EU countries is 178.8 GW, with Germany in first position, with a total installed capacity of 59.3 GW, followed by Spain and the UK, with 23.5 and 21.0 GW installed, respectively \cite{WindEurope2019}. Figure \ref{fig: EUrank} displays the detailed percentage of electricity demand covered by wind in the EU.
